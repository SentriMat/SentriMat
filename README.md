# SentriMat: IoT-Enabled Package Security System

**SentriMat** is a privacy-first, camera-free security solution designed to mitigate porch piracy through **Dynamic Force-Signature Analysis**. By utilizing a high-frequency sensor matrix, the system distinguishes between authorized deliveries, environmental noise, and unauthorized theft.

## 🚀 Features
* **Impact Force Fingerprinting:** Samples contact force during the first 500ms to identify package material.
* **Spatial CoP Tracking:** Monitors for package tilting or sliding using a multi-channel sensor matrix.
* **Privacy-First Design:** Full security monitoring without intrusive cameras.
* **Automated Data Logging:** Generates time-stamped CSV files for detailed trend analysis.
* **Dual-Factor Verification:** Requires a physical footprint signature and a digital handshake.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Idle Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of environmental and load parameters.
2. **Impact Handshake:** Detects force spikes to verify delivery events through unique time threads.
3. **Secured State:** Monitors Center of Pressure (CoP) stability using calibrated digital sensors.
4. **Retrieval Verification:** Checks for authorized access patterns before allowing weight removal.

## 📈 Future Scope
* **IoT Framework Integration:** Incorporating protocols like MQTT for remote monitoring.
* **Machine Learning:** Integrating algorithms for predictive insights and anomaly detection.
* **Cloud Integration:** Centralized data storage for accessibility from anywhere.
